Abstract class for hierarchy providing territorial data resources.

To view the current repositories used for resolving resources, evaluate:

TerritorialDataProvider currentRepositories.

Data providers can build lists of territorial data, but shouldn't be used to build the TerritorialObjects. To map between raw lists and territorial objects, use TOrganization subclasses.
