Provides behavior for handling administrative structures created for specific goals. 

This class supports adding :

- Creation/Disolution date and Periodization
- Naming and Denomination (descriptions)
- Demonyms
- Populate its contained territories

Basically you can build territory groups in two ways: 

(1) By adding a #newArea or  #newCountry
(2) By subclassing this class to create a new "organization" class.
