Provides behavior for handling classifications. This class supports adding a population to an organization's classification, so can be used by a classifier when matching subjects.

Basically you can build territory groups in two ways: 

(1) By adding a #newArea or  #newCountry
(2) By subclassing this class to create a new "organization" class.
