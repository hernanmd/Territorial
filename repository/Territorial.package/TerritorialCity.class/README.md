Though the classification of an area as a town or city is related to itâ€™s population; different countries have different methods of making this classification. In Territorial library a city is a legal term that represents an urban area with autonomous power or a large settlement (when it does not have legal basis).

A city usually:

- Contains the most of the important administrative offices.
- Merge with, or incorporate surrounding areas.
- Is larger than a town and seat, and more densely populated.
